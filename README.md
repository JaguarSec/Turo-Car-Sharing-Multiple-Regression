# Multiple-Regression Analysis

Dataset: Turo-Car-Sharing

Objective/Question: 
- Which of the several factors offer a meaningful impact on the final price of a trip?

Research/Summary:
- summary statistics on the dataset indicate some potential candidates

Hypothesis:
- Most of the original impressions will be correct to varying degrees after eliminating outliers.

Test Method:
- >> Used Inter-Quartile-Range (IQR) to identify outliers 
- >> Removed Outliers and tripped down the number of categories by eliminating those that were not viable 
- >> Measure the impact of each of the remaing variables individually
- >> Next: Conduct Multiple Linear Regression on different models using a variation of subsets of the variables available 
- >> Compare and Contrast promising models & select the best one

Findings:
- TBD
